Ignored 5 back outs that were backing out changes outside my range (524dabd865ff, a9042561f004, 754dc0c091a6, 27211859cb34, 6286b4578f14).
The first three of these appear to not be tbpl-detectable (i.e. regressions in things that aren't tested on TBPL).

Total backouts csets: 74
Total csets backed out: 116
Total pushes saved by stripping all backout and backed-out csets: 114

Of the 116 csets backed out,
* 37 belonged to single-cset pushes
* 65 belonged to multi-cset pushes that were entirely backed out (16 pushes)
* 14 belonged to multi-cset pushes where the csets were selectively backed out

Reasons for backouts:
Commit message: 4
Build failures: 25
Test failures: 36
Leaks/talos: 5
Premature landing: 1
